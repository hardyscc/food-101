%classConfidence Calculates the class confidence scores for each sample in
%the validation set
%   The class confidence score for a sample s belonging in class y is 
% defined as the products of delta(l,s) with p(y,l), sumed over every
% leaf in the forest and divided by the number of trees in the forest.

% classConf(y,s) : Confidence that sample s belongs to class y
% classDist(y,l) : Empirical distribution of the class y in leaf l
% delta(l,s) : Auxilliary variable that indicates presence or not of sample
% s in leaf l

%distinctiveness Calculates the distintiveness measuere for each
%combination of leaf - class
%   The distinctiveness measure for a leaf class combination shows how
%   many discriminative samples for the particular class are contained in
%   the particular leaf. Leaves with high distinctiveness are those which
%   collect many discriminative samples i.e those that have a high class
%   confidence score.

%   The deltas are a simple auxilliary variable that show whether or not a
%   particular sample reaches a particular leaf in the forest. i.e
%   delta(l,s) is defined as follows:
%                { 1, if the sample s has reached the leaf l
%   delta(l,s) = {
%                { 0, otherwise
