function grid = spatialPyramid(levels, image, segments, badSegments)
%spatialPyramid Implements a spatial pyramid scheme
%   Returns an object that contains the points that
%   constitute the rectangles of the grid at the various levels of
%   resolution, as specified by levels.
%   A spatial pyramid is a collection of orderless feature histograms 
%   computed over cells defined by a multi-level recursive image 
%   decomposition. At level 0, the decomposition consists of just a single 
%   cell, and the representation is equivalent to a standard BoF. 
%   At level 1, the image is subdivided into four quadrants, yielding four 
%   feature histograms, and so on.
